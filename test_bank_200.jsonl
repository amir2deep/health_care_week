Vitamin K exists in several forms, for example, in plants as phylloquinone (or vitamin K1), and in intestinal bacterial flora as menaquinone (or vitamin K2). A synthetic form of vitamin K, menadione, is available.Function of vitamin K 1. Formation of g-carboxyglutamate (GLA): Vitamin K is required in the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin and blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursor molecules. Formation of the clotting factors requires the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to Gla residues (Figure 28.26). This forms a mature clotting factor that contains Gla and is capable of subsequent activation. The reaction requires O2, CO2, and the hydroquinone form of vitamin K. The formation of GLA is sensitive to inhibition by dicumarol, an anticoagulant occurring naturally in spoiled sweet clover, and by warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K.Ref: Lippincott, 5th edition, page no: 389", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "topic_name": "vitamins", "length_of_question": 72, "length_max_ans": 9, "gpt-4.1-nano": 3, "gpt-4.1-mini": 3, "gpt-5": 3, "gpt-5-nano": 3, "gpt-5-mini": 3, "gpt-4.1": 3}

The only apoprotein present in LDL is apo B100 (Fig. 12.12). Most of the LDL paicles are derived from VLDL, but a small pa is directly released from liver. The half-life of LDL in blood is about 2 days. Metabolism of LDL and LDL Receptors LDL is taken up by peripheral tissues by receptor mediated endocytosis (see Fig. 12.13). LDL receptors are present on all cells but most abundant in hepatic cells. LDL receptors are located in specialised regions called clathrin-coated pitsBinding of LDL to the receptor is by apo-B-100 and uptake of cholesterol from LDL is a highly regulated process. When the apo-B-100 binds to the apo-B-100 receptor, the receptor-LDL complex is internalised by endocytosis. The endosome vesicle thus formed fuses with lysosomes.The receptor is recycled and returns to the cell surface. The LDL paicle, along with apoproteins and cholesterol ester are hydrolysed by lysosomal hydrolases, forming amino acids and free cholesterol. The free receptors can now return to the membrane surface to bind fuher LDL molecules (Fig. 12.13).Approximately 70% of LDL is degraded in the liver, and the rest in extra-hepatic tissues. For their work on LDL receptors, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein were awarded Nobel prize in 1985. Function of LDL About 75% of the plasma cholesterol is incorporated into the LDL paicles. LDL transpos cholesterol from liver to the peripheral tissues. The cholesterol thus liberated in the cell has three major fates:It is used for the synthesis of other steroids like steroid hormones.Cholesterol may be incorporated into the membranes.Cholesterol may be esterified to a MUFA by acyl cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) for storage. The cellular content of cholesterol regulates fuher endogenous synthesis of cholesterol by regulating HMG CoA reductase. LDL and Clinical Applications LDL concentration in blood has positive correlation with incidence of cardiovascular diseases. A fraction of cholesterol is taken up by macrophages, this is not a regulated pathway. Increased levels of LDL or modification of LDL by glycation (as seen in diabetes mellitus) or oxidation increases the fraction of cholesterol taken up by macrophages. LDL infiltrates through aerial walls and is taken up by macrophages or scavenger cells. This is the staing event of atherosclerosis leading to myocardial infarction (see coronary aery diseases in Chapter 25). When these cells become engorged with cholesterol, foam cells are formed, that get deposited in the subendothelial space triggering formation of atheromatous plaque (see Fig. 25.3). Procoagulant changes are induced in the endothelium resulting in increased chances of thrombosis and coronary aery disease (Fig. 25.4). Since LDL-cholesterol is thus deposited in tissues, the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) variety is called \"bad cholesterol\" and LDL as \"Lethally Dangerous Lipoprotein\" in common parlanceRef: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 153-154", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "topic_name": "Metabolism of lipid", "length_of_question": 45, "length_max_ans": 11, "gpt-4.1-nano": 1, "gpt-4.1-mini": 1, "gpt-5": 1, "gpt-5-nano": 0, "gpt-5-mini": 1, "gpt-4.1": 1}

About 1 mg/day is degraded in the Body excess is rapidly excreted in the urine. Physiological role After conversion in the body to Thiamine pyrophosphate, it acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism: decarboxylation of ketoacids and hexose monophosphate shunt. The requirement is dependent upon carbohydrate intake-about 0.3 mg/ 1000 Kcal. It also plays some role in neuromuscular transmission. Deficiency symptoms -The syndrome of thiamine deficiency beriberi is seen in dry and wet forms: Dry beriberi: Neurological symptoms are prominent-polyneuritis with numbness, tingling, hyperesthesia, muscular weakness and atrophy resulting in 'wrist drop', 'foot drop', paralysis of the whole limb, mental changes, sluggishness, poor memory, loss of appetite and constipation. Wet beriberi: Cardiovascular system is primarily affected-palpitation, breathlessness, high out- put cardiac failure and ECG changes. Therapeutic uses 1. Prophylactically (2-10 mg daily) in infants, pregnant women, chronic diarrheas, patients on parenteral alimentation. Glucose infusion unmasks marginal thiamine deficiency. 2. Beriberi-100 mg/day i.m. or i.v. till symptoms regress-then maintenance doses orally. 3. Acute alcoholic intoxication: thiamine 100 mg is added to each vac of glucose solution infused. Most neurological symptoms in chronic alcoholics are due to thiamine deficiency-peripheral neuritis, Wernick's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis: give 100 mg/ day parenterally. 4. In neurological and cardiovascular disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic anorexia, and obstinate constipation-thiamine has been used even without definite proof of its deficiency- symptoms improve dramatically if thiamine deficiency has been causative.

Preputial glands were first noted by Edward Tyson and in 1694 fully described by William Cowper who named them Tyson's glands after Tyson. They are described as modified sebaceous glands located around the corona and inner surface of the prepuce of the human penis . They are believed to be most frequently found in the balanopreputial sulcus .Bulbourethral gland, also called Cowper's Gland , either of two pea-shaped glands in the male, located beneath the prostate gland at the beginning of the internal poion of the penis; they add fluids to semen during the process of ejaculation. The Baholin's glands (also called Baholin glands or greater vestibular glands ) are two pea sized compound racemose glands located slightly posterior and to the left and right of the opening of the vagina. They secrete mucus to lubricate the vagina and are homologous to bulbourethral glands in males.Brunner's glands (or duodenal glands ) are compound tubular submucosal glands found in that poion of the duodenum which is above the hepatopancreatic sphincter (aka sphincter of Oddi).", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": "Urology", "length_of_question": 21, "length_max_ans": 15, "gpt-4.1-nano": 0, "gpt-4.1-mini": 0, "gpt-5": 0, "gpt-5-nano": 0, "gpt-5-mini": 0, "gpt-4.1": 0}
